# Turin porting guide

Turin is a Rust/GPUI port of [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code):
**t3 fork but without all the bullshit.**

Upstream reference: `pingdotgg/t3code@ec1313c8f8333292506f05a355bb72d308a455d8`,
checked out at `./upstream` (symlink, gitignored).

## Ground rules

1. **Translate, don't redesign.** Upstream logic is the spec. Keep its control
   flow, state machines, names, constants, edge-case handling and comments that
   explain *why*. If upstream does something odd, assume it's load-bearing until
   proven otherwise.
2. **One upstream file → one Rust module** where practical, snake_cased
   (`ProviderTurnStartService.ts` → `provider_turn_start_service.rs`). Every
   module starts with `//! Port of upstream/<path>` so it can be diffed later.
3. **Cut at the seams, not in the middle.** Drop whole features from the cut
   list below. Inside kept code, keep small features even if unused; they can
   be trimmed later.
4. **Fix bugs and perf issues you find**, and record each one in the
   *Deviations* table at the bottom (file, what upstream did, what Turin does,
   why). Same for any place you could not port faithfully.
5. **Port tests for pure logic** (`*.logic.test.ts`, reducers, parsers,
   projections) as `#[cfg(test)]` modules. Skip tests that only exercise the
   Effect runtime, RPC transport, or cut features.

## No client/server split

Upstream is a server (`apps/server`) plus clients that talk to it over a
WebSocket Effect-RPC protocol (`packages/contracts/src/rpc.ts`,
`packages/client-runtime`). Turin is one process: the GPUI app owns the
orchestrator directly. Consequences:

- RPC handlers in `ws.ts` / `*/http.ts` become plain `async fn` methods on the
  owning service. Skip auth, scopes, DPoP, permissions, wire projection,
  bounded snapshot transport, and stream budgets.
- `packages/client-runtime` state (`state/*`) is the UI's view model. Port the
  reducers (they're the read model the UI expects), feed them in-process
  events instead of WS frames.
- Persisted JSON (SQLite rows, event payloads, settings files) keeps the
  upstream shape so a T3 database can be imported.

## Effect → Rust mapping

Revised after QC `wf_6ce02f2f-38c` (docs/qc/). Helpers live in
`turin_contracts::base_schemas`; use them, never hand-roll equivalents.

### Schemas (wire/DB shape must match upstream byte for byte)

| Effect Schema | Rust |
|---|---|
| `Schema.Struct` | `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` struct |
| `Schema.Literals([...])` | enum, exact `#[serde(rename = "...")]` per variant |
| tagged unions (`_tag` / `type` discriminator) | `#[serde(tag = "...")]` enum |
| `ForwardCompatibleUnion(members, tag)` | `ForwardCompatible<T>` + `impl TaggedUnion for T` (+ a test calling `assert_known_tags`). **Never** `#[serde(other)]` or `untagged` catch-alls: they swallow broken known payloads and re-encode unknowns, both of which upstream forbids |
| `ForwardCompatibleUnionArray` | `#[serde(with = "forward_compatible_union_array")] Vec<T>` |
| `ForwardCompatibleArray` | `#[serde(with = "forward_compatible_array")] Vec<T>` |
| `optional`/`optionalKey(ForwardCompatibleArray(X))` | `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "forward_compatible_array::optional")] Option<Vec<X>>` (same for `forward_compatible_union_array::optional`; landing in T00c) |
| `hasUnknownUnionTag` | `has_unknown_union_tag` |
| `Schema.optional(X)` / `Schema.optionalKey(X)` | `Option<X>` + `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]` |
| `Schema.NullOr(X)` (required key) | `Option<X>`, no skip (encodes `null`) |
| `optional`/`optionalKey(NullOr(X))` (absent ≠ null) | `Option<Option<X>>` + `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "double_option")]`. absent = unchanged/inherit, `null` = clear. Plain `Option<Option<_>>` without `with` silently collapses null |
| `X.pipe(withDecodingDefault(() => v))` | non-`Option` field + `#[serde(default = "default_<field>")]` returning upstream's exact `v`; **no** `skip_serializing_if` (upstream always encodes the key). Bare `#[serde(default)]` only when `v == Default::default()`. Applies to struct/record/array defaults too |
| `ForwardCompatibleOptional(X)` | `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "forward_compatible_optional")] Option<X>` |
| `ForwardCompatibleOptional(NullOr(X))` | `Option<Option<X>>` + `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "forward_compatible_optional_nullable")]` |
| `ForwardCompatibleNullable(X)` | `#[serde(default, with = "forward_compatible_nullable")] Option<X>` (encodes `null`) |
| `OmittedWhenNull(X)` | `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "omitted_when_null")] Option<X>` |
| `TrimmedString` / `TrimmedNonEmptyString` | same-named types; trimming uses `js_trim` (JS `trim()` semantics, not Rust `str::trim`) |
| branded ids (`ThreadId`, …) | declare in the `id!` list in base_schemas.rs (opaque `Arc<str>` newtype with `new`/`random`/`as_str`). Never hand-write id newtypes |
| `Schema.Number` | `f64` (fractional values exist, e.g. `costUsd`) |
| `Schema.Int` / `NonNegativeInt` | `i64` / `u64` |
| `PositiveInt` | `PositiveInt` (validating newtype, rejects 0) |
| `Schema.Record(K, V)` | `IndexMap<K, V>` or `serde_json::Map` (keeps key order; never `HashMap` for persisted data) |
| `IsoDateTime` (`Schema.String`) | `String`, passed through untouched |
| `DateTimeUtc` / `DateTimeUtcFromString`, every `*_at` column | `UtcDateTime`: always encodes `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ`. Upstream compares these as text (`ORDER BY created_at`, `available_at <=`), so format drift misorders rows |
| `Schema.TaggedError` | `thiserror` enum variant, same name |

### Services and effects

| Effect | Rust |
|---|---|
| `Effect.gen` / `Effect<A, E, R>` | `async fn … -> Result<A, E>` |
| `Context.Service` + `Layer` | plain struct; deps passed to `new()` as `Arc<…>`. Trait only when upstream has multiple implementations (provider adapters, VCS drivers, source-control drivers) |
| `Ref` / `SynchronizedRef` | `parking_lot::Mutex` (sync sections) / `tokio::sync::Mutex` (only if held across `.await`) |
| `Deferred` | `tokio::sync::oneshot` (single) / `watch` (many readers) |
| `Semaphore.make(n)` + `withPermits` | `Arc<tokio::sync::Semaphore>`; `acquire_owned` when the permit outlives the scope |
| `Effect.forEach/all(…, {concurrency: n})` | `stream::iter(..).map(f).buffered(n)` (ordered) / `buffer_unordered(n)` if upstream discards order; `"unbounded"` → `try_join_all`; no option → sequential loop |
| `PubSub.unbounded` | per-subscriber `mpsc::unbounded_channel` fan-out (publishing never waits), or `broadcast` **with** an explicit `Lagged` handler that replays from the store |
| `PubSub.sliding(n)` | `broadcast::channel(n)` |
| `Queue.unbounded` / `.bounded(n)` / `.dropping(n)` / `.sliding(n)` | `mpsc::unbounded_channel` / `mpsc::channel(n)` / `try_send` on bounded / `VecDeque` + `Notify` |
| `Stream` | `futures::Stream` |
| `Fiber` / `forkScoped` / `forkDaemon` | task owned by a `JoinSet` or `tokio_util::task::AbortOnDropHandle` tied to its owner, plus `CancellationToken` for cooperative stop. **Never drop a bare `JoinHandle`** (it detaches, unlike Effect's scoped interruption) |
| `Effect.timeout` | `tokio::time::timeout`; on timeout the underlying work must actually stop (abort task / kill process) |
| child processes | `tokio::process::Command` with `kill_on_drop(true)`; long-lived CLIs (providers, hooks) run in their own process group and the group is killed on timeout/shutdown |
| `Schedule` / retries | explicit loop with the same delays and caps |
| `@effect/sql` SQLite | `turin_persistence::Db`: one writer connection (upstream: single writer behind `Semaphore(1)`) + a read-only reader connection, upstream PRAGMAs verbatim. `db.write(|tx| …)` runs a whole transaction in one blocking call; stores take `&Transaction`/`&Connection` so several compose in one transaction (upstream `sql.withTransaction`). Async work (publishing) happens after commit |

**Rules:** never do a bounded `send().await` or any `.await` while holding a
DB transaction or a sync lock.

Async runtime: tokio for all backend work. The GPUI app spawns a multi-thread
tokio runtime at startup and bridges results into entities via channels.

## Module map

| Turin crate | Upstream source |
|---|---|
| `contracts` | `packages/contracts/src` (kept files only, see below) |
| `shared` | `packages/shared/src` (kept files only) |
| `persistence` | `apps/server/src/persistence` (SQLite, migrations, event store) |
| `git` | `apps/server/src/{git,vcs,checkpointing}`, `apps/server/src/workspace` |
| `source-control` | `packages/source-control-{core,github}`, `apps/server/src/{sourceControl,pullRequest}` |
| `provider-core` | `packages/provider-core`, `apps/server/src/provider` (registry, catalog, auth for kept providers) |
| `codex-app-server` | `packages/effect-codex-app-server` (generated protocol types + stdio JSON-RPC client) |
| `provider-codex` | `orchestration-v2/Adapters/CodexAdapterV2.ts`, `provider/Codex*` |
| `provider-claude` | `orchestration-v2/Adapters/ClaudeAdapterV2.ts`, `provider/Claude*`; the TS Agent SDK is replaced by speaking the `claude` CLI stream-json control protocol directly (same protocol the SDK uses) |
| `provider-opencode` | `packages/provider-opencode` (HTTP+SSE to `opencode serve`) |
| `provider-cursor` | `packages/provider-cursor` |
| `orchestration` | `apps/server/src/orchestration-v2` (minus wire/transport files), `apps/server/src/project` |
| `hooks` | **new**, replaces thread launch / worktree creation (see below) |
| `app` | `apps/web/src` → GPUI, `packages/client-runtime/src/state` reducers. Binary `turin`. |

When a kept type references a cut type, drop that field and note it in
Deviations.

## Cut list (whole features)

- T3 Connect, relay, cloud, remote access, pairing, auth/sessions, DPoP, Tailscale, SSH, WSL
- Mobile app, marketing site, Electron shell, auto-updates, telemetry, resource telemetry
- Every source-control host except GitHub (GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, Forgejo, GitCafe)
- Every provider except Codex, Claude, OpenCode, Cursor (no ACP registry, Grok, Pi, Muse, Antigravity)
- Terminal / PTY, browser / preview / devices, HTML render, MCP apps, orchestrator MCP server
- File tree side panel, scheduled tasks, legacy v1 importer, project clone
- **Thread launch into new worktree / new thread spawning** → replaced by hooks

## Kept features (must match upstream look and feel)

- Sidebar: projects → threads, status indicators, snooze, drag, search, hover cards
- Thread view: messages timeline, markdown, tool cards, approvals, pending user input,
  plan follow-up, context window meter, usage limits, wrapping behaviour
- Composer: rich prompt editor, mentions, model picker, attachments, stash, queue/steer
- Diff: changed files tree, turn diffs, full thread diff, checkpoints and rollback
- Git: status, branches, commit/push flows (`GitWorkflowService`), checkpoints
- GitHub PRs: list + filters, detail (summary, timeline, code, checks, reviews, guide),
  thread↔PR linking, PR stacks, watch/sync reactors, review guides, files viewed
- Settings and keybindings with upstream defaults

## Hooks (new)

Replaces `ThreadLaunchService` / worktree setup. User-defined shell commands
that run on orchestrator events. Config in `~/.turin/hooks.toml` and
per-project `.turin/hooks.toml`:

```toml
[[hook]]
event = "thread.created"        # thread.created | turn.started | turn.completed
                                # | turn.failed | approval.requested | pr.linked
                                # | pr.checks.completed | git.committed
command = "./scripts/setup.sh"
cwd = "project"                 # project | thread (thread's workspace path)
blocking = false                # true: wait before continuing (thread.created only)
timeout_secs = 300
```

Hooks get event JSON on stdin and `TURIN_*` env vars (`TURIN_EVENT`,
`TURIN_PROJECT_ID`, `TURIN_THREAD_ID`, `TURIN_CWD`, …).

## Deviations

| File | Upstream | Turin | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `TrimmedNonEmptyString` trims only on decode/encode | trims at construction | no untrimmed state can exist, so `" "` can never encode to `""` |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `UnknownUnionMember { tag, value }` | adds `raw: Value` | lets callers render/log unknown members without re-reading the row |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `DateTimeUtc` keeps ms precision via JS `Date` | `UtcDateTime` truncates to ms on construction/parse | `Eq`/`Ord` agree with the wire form |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `PositiveInt` is a refined number | newtype over `NonZeroU64` with `new(u64) -> Option<Self>` | 0 unrepresentable |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `isUnknownUnionMember(value)` | no function; match `ForwardCompatible::Unknown` | Rust enums make it a pattern |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `PortSchema` | omitted | only used by cut features |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | cut-feature exports (AuthSessionId, RpcClientId, SecretRef, DpopFailureReason, Client* enums) | omitted | features cut (PORTING cut list) |
| `codex-app-server/src/generated/types.generated.rs` | Effect importer emits concrete field types for 2,328 protocol schemas | generated transparent serde `Value` wrappers with `TryFrom<Value>` validation against the pinned JSON Schema; method and namespace metadata are generated separately | `typify` 0.6.2 panicked in `merge.rs` on the aggregate pinned schema; wrappers preserve exact JSON including absent versus null fields while runtime validation enforces schema constraints at the client boundary |
| `codex-app-server/src/schema.rs` | Effect codecs may transform decoded objects and supply decoding defaults | JSON Schema validation accepts/rejects input without transforming it; valid input retains its JSON field shape through serde | avoids inventing transformations that the Codex JSON Schema does not specify; callers see the original wire object |
| `codex-app-server/src/errors.rs` | Effect `SchemaIssue` trees provide issue kinds, counts, and path depth, with opaque `cause` defects | Rust errors retain operation, method, request ID, JSON-RPC code/message/data, and a textual JSON Schema validation detail | `jsonschema` reports a different issue tree; exact Effect diagnostic metadata cannot be derived from it |
| `codex-app-server/src/replay.rs` | replay errors are tagged Effect errors containing scenario, cursor, label, and frame details; extra outbound frames can be observed until the scope closes | Rust replay errors expose cursor and relevant frame details, and the driver checks for extra frames for 10 ms after completion | no Effect scope/sink lifecycle in the Rust duplex driver; the bounded final check avoids leaving the replay task alive after a successful transcript |
| `codex-app-server/src/schema.rs` | Effect schema errors can embed the rejected value in `cause` only | `jsonschema` failures are reported with `ValidationError::masked`, so the instance text is replaced before it reaches an error string | the default `Display` includes the rejected value, which would copy secrets into logs and request errors |
| `codex-app-server/src/protocol.rs` | a failed stdout sink surfaces as an Effect defect | write failures are `Transport { operation: "write-output-stream" }` and terminate the session | upstream only names `read-input-stream` and `read-process-exit-status` |
| `codex-app-server/src/client.rs` | closing the Effect scope kills the child | `shutdown` sends `SIGTERM` to the process group, waits 2 seconds, then `SIGKILL`; `Drop` sends `SIGKILL`. `kill_on_drop` still applies | there is no Effect scope; the grace period lets the child exit before the group is killed |
| `codex-app-server/src/extensions.rs` | `revertCodexThread` lives in `apps/server` and returns the `thread/revert` or `thread/read` response directly | the same paging and response selection lives next to the protocol client. `thread/reverted` is not awaited | the wire rule is part of this crate so a later provider port cannot block on a notification the `thread/read` branch never sends |
