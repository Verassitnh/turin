# Turin porting guide

Turin is a Rust/GPUI port of [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code):
**t3 fork but without all the bullshit.**

Upstream reference: `pingdotgg/t3code@ec1313c8f8333292506f05a355bb72d308a455d8`,
checked out at `./upstream` (symlink, gitignored).

## Ground rules

1. **Translate, don't redesign.** Upstream logic is the spec. Keep its control
   flow, state machines, names, constants, edge-case handling and comments that
   explain *why*. If upstream does something odd, assume it's load-bearing until
   proven otherwise.
2. **One upstream file → one Rust module** where practical, snake_cased
   (`ProviderTurnStartService.ts` → `provider_turn_start_service.rs`). Every
   module starts with `//! Port of upstream/<path>` so it can be diffed later.
3. **Cut at the seams, not in the middle.** Drop whole features from the cut
   list below. Inside kept code, keep small features even if unused; they can
   be trimmed later.
4. **Fix bugs and perf issues you find**, and record each one in the
   *Deviations* table at the bottom (file, what upstream did, what Turin does,
   why). Same for any place you could not port faithfully.
5. **Port tests for pure logic** (`*.logic.test.ts`, reducers, parsers,
   projections) as `#[cfg(test)]` modules. Skip tests that only exercise the
   Effect runtime, RPC transport, or cut features.

## No client/server split

Upstream is a server (`apps/server`) plus clients that talk to it over a
WebSocket Effect-RPC protocol (`packages/contracts/src/rpc.ts`,
`packages/client-runtime`). Turin is one process: the GPUI app owns the
orchestrator directly. Consequences:

- RPC handlers in `ws.ts` / `*/http.ts` become plain `async fn` methods on the
  owning service. Skip auth, scopes, DPoP, permissions, wire projection,
  bounded snapshot transport, and stream budgets.
- `packages/client-runtime` state (`state/*`) is the UI's view model. Port the
  reducers (they're the read model the UI expects), feed them in-process
  events instead of WS frames.
- Persisted JSON (SQLite rows, event payloads, settings files) keeps the
  upstream shape so a T3 database can be imported.

## Effect → Rust mapping

Revised after QC `wf_6ce02f2f-38c` (docs/qc/). Helpers live in
`turin_contracts::base_schemas`; use them, never hand-roll equivalents.

### Schemas (wire/DB shape must match upstream byte for byte)

| Effect Schema | Rust |
|---|---|
| `Schema.Struct` | `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` struct |
| `Schema.Literals([...])` | enum, exact `#[serde(rename = "...")]` per variant |
| tagged unions (`_tag` / `type` discriminator) | `#[serde(tag = "...")]` enum |
| `ForwardCompatibleUnion(members, tag)` | `ForwardCompatible<T>` + `impl TaggedUnion for T` (+ a test calling `assert_known_tags`). **Never** `#[serde(other)]` or `untagged` catch-alls: they swallow broken known payloads and re-encode unknowns, both of which upstream forbids |
| `ForwardCompatibleUnionArray` | `#[serde(with = "forward_compatible_union_array")] Vec<T>` |
| `ForwardCompatibleArray` | `#[serde(with = "forward_compatible_array")] Vec<T>` |
| `optional`/`optionalKey(ForwardCompatibleArray(X))` | `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "forward_compatible_array::optional")] Option<Vec<X>>` (same for `forward_compatible_union_array::optional`; landing in T00c) |
| `hasUnknownUnionTag` | `has_unknown_union_tag` |
| `Schema.optional(X)` / `Schema.optionalKey(X)` | `Option<X>` + `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]` |
| `Schema.NullOr(X)` (required key) | `Option<X>`, no skip (encodes `null`) |
| `optional`/`optionalKey(NullOr(X))` (absent ≠ null) | `Option<Option<X>>` + `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "double_option")]`. absent = unchanged/inherit, `null` = clear. Plain `Option<Option<_>>` without `with` silently collapses null |
| `X.pipe(withDecodingDefault(() => v))` | non-`Option` field + `#[serde(default = "default_<field>")]` returning upstream's exact `v`; **no** `skip_serializing_if` (upstream always encodes the key). Bare `#[serde(default)]` only when `v == Default::default()`. Applies to struct/record/array defaults too |
| `ForwardCompatibleOptional(X)` | `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "forward_compatible_optional")] Option<X>` |
| `ForwardCompatibleOptional(NullOr(X))` | `Option<Option<X>>` + `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "forward_compatible_optional_nullable")]` |
| `ForwardCompatibleNullable(X)` | `#[serde(default, with = "forward_compatible_nullable")] Option<X>` (encodes `null`) |
| `OmittedWhenNull(X)` | `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "omitted_when_null")] Option<X>` |
| `TrimmedString` / `TrimmedNonEmptyString` | same-named types; trimming uses `js_trim` (JS `trim()` semantics, not Rust `str::trim`) |
| branded ids (`ThreadId`, …) | declare in the `id!` list in base_schemas.rs (opaque `Arc<str>` newtype with `new`/`random`/`as_str`). Never hand-write id newtypes |
| `Schema.Number` | `f64` (fractional values exist, e.g. `costUsd`) |
| `Schema.Int` / `NonNegativeInt` | `i64` / `u64` |
| `PositiveInt` | `PositiveInt` (validating newtype, rejects 0) |
| `Schema.Record(K, V)` | `IndexMap<K, V>` or `serde_json::Map` (keeps key order; never `HashMap` for persisted data) |
| `IsoDateTime` (`Schema.String`) | `String`, passed through untouched |
| `DateTimeUtc` / `DateTimeUtcFromString` | `UtcDateTime`: always encodes `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ`. Upstream compares these as text (`ORDER BY created_at`), so format drift misorders rows. `IsoDateTime` and `*_at` columns whose upstream schema is `IsoDateTime` stay `String` |
| `Schema.TaggedError` | `thiserror` enum variant, same name |

### Services and effects

| Effect | Rust |
|---|---|
| `Effect.gen` / `Effect<A, E, R>` | `async fn … -> Result<A, E>` |
| `Context.Service` + `Layer` | plain struct; deps passed to `new()` as `Arc<…>`. Trait only when upstream has multiple implementations (provider adapters, VCS drivers, source-control drivers) |
| `Ref` / `SynchronizedRef` | `parking_lot::Mutex` (sync sections) / `tokio::sync::Mutex` (only if held across `.await`) |
| `Deferred` | `tokio::sync::oneshot` (single) / `watch` (many readers) |
| `Semaphore.make(n)` + `withPermits` | `Arc<tokio::sync::Semaphore>`; `acquire_owned` when the permit outlives the scope |
| `Effect.forEach/all(…, {concurrency: n})` | `stream::iter(..).map(f).buffered(n)` (ordered) / `buffer_unordered(n)` if upstream discards order; `"unbounded"` → `try_join_all`; no option → sequential loop |
| `PubSub.unbounded` | per-subscriber `mpsc::unbounded_channel` fan-out (publishing never waits), or `broadcast` **with** an explicit `Lagged` handler that replays from the store |
| `PubSub.sliding(n)` | `broadcast::channel(n)` |
| `Queue.unbounded` / `.bounded(n)` / `.dropping(n)` / `.sliding(n)` | `mpsc::unbounded_channel` / `mpsc::channel(n)` / `try_send` on bounded / `VecDeque` + `Notify` |
| `Stream` | `futures::Stream` |
| `Fiber` / `forkScoped` / `forkDaemon` | task owned by a `JoinSet` or `tokio_util::task::AbortOnDropHandle` tied to its owner, plus `CancellationToken` for cooperative stop. **Never drop a bare `JoinHandle`** (it detaches, unlike Effect's scoped interruption) |
| `Effect.timeout` | `tokio::time::timeout`; on timeout the underlying work must actually stop (abort task / kill process) |
| child processes | `tokio::process::Command` with `kill_on_drop(true)`; long-lived CLIs (providers, hooks) run in their own process group and the group is killed on timeout/shutdown |
| `Schedule` / retries | explicit loop with the same delays and caps |
| `@effect/sql` SQLite | `turin_persistence::Db`: one writer connection (upstream: single writer behind `Semaphore(1)`) + a read-only reader connection, upstream PRAGMAs verbatim. `db.write(|tx| …)` runs a whole transaction in one blocking call; stores take `&Transaction`/`&Connection` so several compose in one transaction (upstream `sql.withTransaction`). Async work (publishing) happens after commit |

**Rules:** never do a bounded `send().await` or any `.await` while holding a
DB transaction or a sync lock.

Async runtime: tokio for all backend work. The GPUI app spawns a multi-thread
tokio runtime at startup and bridges results into entities via channels.

## Module map

| Turin crate | Upstream source |
|---|---|
| `contracts` | `packages/contracts/src` (kept files only, see below) |
| `shared` | `packages/shared/src` (kept files only) |
| `persistence` | `apps/server/src/persistence` (SQLite, migrations, event store) |
| `git` | `apps/server/src/{git,vcs,checkpointing}`, `apps/server/src/workspace` |
| `source-control` | `packages/source-control-{core,github}`, `apps/server/src/{sourceControl,pullRequest}` |
| `provider-core` | `packages/provider-core`, `apps/server/src/provider` (registry, catalog, auth for kept providers) |
| `codex-app-server` | `packages/effect-codex-app-server` (generated protocol types + stdio JSON-RPC client) |
| `provider-codex` | `orchestration-v2/Adapters/CodexAdapterV2.ts`, `provider/Codex*` |
| `claude-protocol` | replaces `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` (pinned version): `claude` CLI launch flags, stream-json frames, control protocol, SDK-local helpers (transcript fork etc.) |
| `acp` | `packages/effect-acp` (Agent Client Protocol JSON-RPC client) |
| `provider-claude` | `orchestration-v2/Adapters/ClaudeAdapterV2.ts`, `provider/Claude*`; the TS Agent SDK is replaced by speaking the `claude` CLI stream-json control protocol directly (same protocol the SDK uses) |
| `provider-opencode` | `packages/provider-opencode`: version probe + both generations (v1 `server/adapter.ts`+`OpenCodeRuntime.ts` for 1.x, which is what users have installed today; v2 `server/v2/*` for ≥2) |
| `provider-cursor` | `packages/provider-cursor` minus the in-process `@cursor/sdk` runtime; transport is `cursor-agent acp` via `acp` + upstream `AcpAdapterV2` (new Cursor flavor, see Deviations) |
| `orchestration` | `apps/server/src/orchestration-v2` (minus wire/transport files), `apps/server/src/project` |
| `hooks` | **new**, replaces thread launch / worktree creation (see below) |
| `app` | `apps/web/src` → GPUI, `packages/client-runtime/src/state` reducers. Binary `turin`. |

### Contracts: keep

When a kept type references a cut type, drop that field and note it in
Deviations.

## Cut list (whole features)

- T3 Connect, relay, cloud, remote access, pairing, auth/sessions, DPoP, Tailscale, SSH, WSL
- Mobile app, marketing site, Electron shell, auto-updates, telemetry, resource telemetry
- Every source-control host except GitHub (GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, Forgejo, GitCafe)
- Every provider except Codex, Claude, OpenCode, Cursor (no ACP registry, Grok, Pi, Muse, Antigravity)
- Terminal / PTY, browser / preview / devices, HTML render, MCP apps, orchestrator MCP server
- File tree side panel, scheduled tasks, legacy v1 importer, project clone
- **Thread launch into new worktree / new thread spawning** → replaced by hooks

## Kept features (must match upstream look and feel)

- Sidebar: projects → threads, status indicators, snooze, drag, search, hover cards
- Thread view: messages timeline, markdown, tool cards, approvals, pending user input,
  plan follow-up, context window meter, usage limits, wrapping behaviour
- Composer: rich prompt editor, mentions, model picker, attachments, stash, queue/steer
- Diff: changed files tree, turn diffs, full thread diff, checkpoints and rollback
- Git: status, branches, commit/push flows (`GitWorkflowService`), checkpoints
- GitHub PRs: list + filters, detail (summary, timeline, code, checks, reviews, guide),
  thread↔PR linking, PR stacks, watch/sync reactors, review guides, files viewed
- Settings and keybindings with upstream defaults

## Hooks (new)

Replaces `ThreadLaunchService` / worktree setup. User-defined shell commands
that run on orchestrator events. Config in `~/.turin/hooks.toml` and
per-project `.turin/hooks.toml`:

```toml
[[hook]]
event = "thread.created"        # thread.created | turn.started | turn.completed
                                # | turn.failed | approval.requested | pr.linked
                                # | pr.checks.completed | git.committed
command = "./scripts/setup.sh"
cwd = "project"                 # project | thread (thread's workspace path)
blocking = false                # true: wait before continuing (thread.created only)
timeout_secs = 300
```

Hooks get event JSON on stdin and `TURIN_*` env vars (`TURIN_EVENT`,
`TURIN_PROJECT_ID`, `TURIN_THREAD_ID`, `TURIN_CWD`, …).

## Deviations

| File | Upstream | Turin | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `provider-cursor` | runs `@cursor/sdk` local executor in-process (Node) | `cursor-agent acp` subprocess over ACP | Rust can't host the JS SDK and it has no stable wire protocol; ACP is Cursor's supported external protocol. Gains interactive approvals; loses SDK-only features (autoReview, run recovery via listRuns, per-send `{id,params}` model selection). QC wf_42618e43-71a |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `TrimmedNonEmptyString` trims only on decode/encode | trims at construction | no untrimmed state can exist, so `" "` can never encode to `""` |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `UnknownUnionMember { tag, value }` | adds `raw: Value` | lets callers render/log unknown members without re-reading the row |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `DateTimeUtc` keeps ms precision via JS `Date` | `UtcDateTime` truncates to ms on construction/parse | `Eq`/`Ord` agree with the wire form |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `PositiveInt` is a refined number | newtype over `NonZeroU64` with `new(u64) -> Option<Self>` | 0 unrepresentable |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `isUnknownUnionMember(value)` | no function; match `ForwardCompatible::Unknown` | Rust enums make it a pattern |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `PortSchema` | omitted | only used by cut features |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | cut-feature exports (AuthSessionId, RpcClientId, SecretRef, DpopFailureReason, Client* enums) | omitted | features cut (PORTING cut list) |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/reconcileV2PreviewMigration.ts` | Rewrites preview databases that recorded `OrchestrationV2` as migration 53 or 54 so those files keep their ledger and still migrate forward. | Not called. A preview file whose recorded id `>= 55` has a different name, or whose later id would skip a V2 migration, fails closed in `assert_v2_migrations_can_run`. | Fresh databases and released-main files already use the current ids. Rewriting 53/54 would hide a schema this build does not contain. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/OrchestrationEventStore.ts` | Decodes each payload with the orchestration-v2 contract schema. | Payloads stay `serde_json::Value`. Invalid JSON fails. Unknown event types fail a strict read and are skipped when `skip_unknown_event_types` is set. A known type must be a non-empty JSON object. | `turin-contracts` event schemas are not in this crate. Empty-object rejection stands in for "schema rejected a known payload" until those types land. Non-empty but schema-invalid JSON is accepted. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/Errors.ts` | Decode failures name Effect schema issue tags and do not copy the rejected value. | Decode failures carry the serde error string. | There is no Effect schema layer to map. SQL failures still use `SQLITE({code}) {errstr}` and do not include the query text. |
| `packages/shared/src/nodeSqliteClient.ts` | Reader and checkpoint workers are separate Node worker threads. The checkpoint worker uses `wal_checkpoint(NOOP)` and stays off when SQLite is older than 3.51. | One process: a `SQLITE_OPEN_READ_ONLY` connection for reads, and a `std` thread for checkpoints, joined on `Db` drop. Same pragmas, 1000-frame passive threshold, 100ms one-shot idle flush, and writer autocheckpoint of 10000. The side connection is opened before that pragma is raised. The worker is not started when `sqlite_version()` is below 3.51. `:memory:` has no reader and no checkpoint thread. | A second connection cannot see an in-memory database. Bundled SQLite is 3.53.2 (`rusqlite` 0.40 / `libsqlite3-sys` 0.38), so file databases start the worker. Below 3.51 the writer keeps the default autocheckpoint. |
| `packages/shared/src/Sqlite.ts` | `PRAGMA optimize` on the upstream SQLite build does not create `sqlite_stat4`. | The same `PRAGMA optimize = 0x10012` runs. Bundled SQLite is compiled with `SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT4`, so optimize creates `sqlite_stat4` as well as `sqlite_stat1`. | Rebuilding SQLite without STAT4 would fork the bundled amalgamation. The extra stats table is unused by queries. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/initializeV2Database.ts` | After the snapshot copy, orchestration lazily imports V1 transcripts. | Copies the committed V1 snapshot (WAL included, uncommitted rows excluded) and stops. | Transcript import depends on the orchestration importer, which is not this crate. |
| `crates/persistence/src/t3_import` | The server migrates its own `statev2.sqlite` in place. `NodeSqlite.backup` only seeds v2 from a sibling v1 file. | `T3Import` opens the T3 file `SQLITE_OPEN_READ_ONLY`, copies it with `sqlite3_backup_step` into `/tmp` (busy and locked steps retry; a failed copy deletes the destination), refuses a ledger id or name this build does not have, migrates the copy, and hard-links it to `~/.turin/statev2.sqlite` only when that file is absent. | Turin must not write the live T3 database. A snapshot of a migration-62 database matched a fresh Turin schema. Every event the v2 reader returns decoded. Unknown types are counted, not treated as decode errors. Legacy v1 thread rows stay in the table and are not part of that read. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/Migrations/009_ProviderSessionRuntimeMode.ts` | Intentional `Effect.asVoid` no-op, still recorded. | Empty script, id still inserted. | Same ledger outcome. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/Migrations/006_*.ts` | Binds `DEFAULT_RUNTIME_MODE` (`full-access`) as a parameter. | The literal `'full-access'` is in the SQL file. | The extracted script has no parameter slot. The written value is the same. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/Migrations/055_OrchestrationV2.ts` | `ApplicationEventSource` runs between thread-launch workflows and effect-cancellation, including a procedural copy. | The generated SQL has `-- TURIN_APPLICATION_EVENT_SOURCE --`. The runner executes the copy in Rust at that point. | Concatenating the TypeScript module would run its static receipt insert before the events it depends on exist. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/*` timestamps | Agent-event `occurredAt` is `DateTimeUtc`. Project `occurredAt`, receipt `acceptedAt`, and provider `lastSeenAt` are `IsoDateTime`. | Agent-event `occurred_at` is `UtcDateTime` and is stored with its canonical `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ` display. Project, receipt, and provider `*_at` stay caller-supplied strings. SQL `strftime` expressions are unchanged. | Only the agent-event field is `DateTimeUtc` upstream. The other timestamps are `IsoDateTime` pass-through. |
