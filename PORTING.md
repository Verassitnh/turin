# Turin porting guide

Turin is a Rust/GPUI port of [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code):
**t3 fork but without all the bullshit.**

Upstream reference: `pingdotgg/t3code@ec1313c8f8333292506f05a355bb72d308a455d8`,
checked out at `./upstream` (symlink, gitignored).

## Ground rules

1. **Translate, don't redesign.** Upstream logic is the spec. Keep its control
   flow, state machines, names, constants, edge-case handling and comments that
   explain *why*. If upstream does something odd, assume it's load-bearing until
   proven otherwise.
2. **One upstream file → one Rust module** where practical, snake_cased
   (`ProviderTurnStartService.ts` → `provider_turn_start_service.rs`). Every
   module starts with `//! Port of upstream/<path>` so it can be diffed later.
3. **Cut at the seams, not in the middle.** Drop whole features from the cut
   list below. Inside kept code, keep small features even if unused; they can
   be trimmed later.
4. **Fix bugs and perf issues you find**, and record each one in the
   *Deviations* table at the bottom (file, what upstream did, what Turin does,
   why). Same for any place you could not port faithfully.
5. **Port tests for pure logic** (`*.logic.test.ts`, reducers, parsers,
   projections) as `#[cfg(test)]` modules. Skip tests that only exercise the
   Effect runtime, RPC transport, or cut features.

## No client/server split

Upstream is a server (`apps/server`) plus clients that talk to it over a
WebSocket Effect-RPC protocol (`packages/contracts/src/rpc.ts`,
`packages/client-runtime`). Turin is one process: the GPUI app owns the
orchestrator directly. Consequences:

- RPC handlers in `ws.ts` / `*/http.ts` become plain `async fn` methods on the
  owning service. Skip auth, scopes, DPoP, permissions, wire projection,
  bounded snapshot transport, and stream budgets.
- `packages/client-runtime` state (`state/*`) is the UI's view model. Port the
  reducers (they're the read model the UI expects), feed them in-process
  events instead of WS frames.
- Persisted JSON (SQLite rows, event payloads, settings files) keeps the
  upstream shape so a T3 database can be imported.

## Effect → Rust mapping

Revised after QC `wf_6ce02f2f-38c` (docs/qc/). Helpers live in
`turin_contracts::base_schemas`; use them, never hand-roll equivalents.

### Schemas (wire/DB shape must match upstream byte for byte)

| Effect Schema | Rust |
|---|---|
| `Schema.Struct` | `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` struct |
| `Schema.Literals([...])` | enum, exact `#[serde(rename = "...")]` per variant |
| tagged unions (`_tag` / `type` discriminator) | `#[serde(tag = "...")]` enum |
| `ForwardCompatibleUnion(members, tag)` | `ForwardCompatible<T>` + `impl TaggedUnion for T` (+ a test calling `assert_known_tags`). **Never** `#[serde(other)]` or `untagged` catch-alls: they swallow broken known payloads and re-encode unknowns, both of which upstream forbids |
| `ForwardCompatibleUnionArray` | `#[serde(with = "forward_compatible_union_array")] Vec<T>` |
| `ForwardCompatibleArray` | `#[serde(with = "forward_compatible_array")] Vec<T>` |
| `optional`/`optionalKey(ForwardCompatibleArray(X))` | `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "forward_compatible_array::optional")] Option<Vec<X>>` (same for `forward_compatible_union_array::optional`; landing in T00c) |
| `hasUnknownUnionTag` | `has_unknown_union_tag` |
| `Schema.optional(X)` / `Schema.optionalKey(X)` | `Option<X>` + `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]` |
| `Schema.NullOr(X)` (required key) | `Option<X>`, no skip (encodes `null`) |
| `optional`/`optionalKey(NullOr(X))` (absent ≠ null) | `Option<Option<X>>` + `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "double_option")]`. absent = unchanged/inherit, `null` = clear. Plain `Option<Option<_>>` without `with` silently collapses null |
| `X.pipe(withDecodingDefault(() => v))` | non-`Option` field + `#[serde(default = "default_<field>")]` returning upstream's exact `v`; **no** `skip_serializing_if` (upstream always encodes the key). Bare `#[serde(default)]` only when `v == Default::default()`. Applies to struct/record/array defaults too |
| `ForwardCompatibleOptional(X)` | `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "forward_compatible_optional")] Option<X>` |
| `ForwardCompatibleOptional(NullOr(X))` | `Option<Option<X>>` + `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "forward_compatible_optional_nullable")]` |
| `ForwardCompatibleNullable(X)` | `#[serde(default, with = "forward_compatible_nullable")] Option<X>` (encodes `null`) |
| `OmittedWhenNull(X)` | `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", with = "omitted_when_null")] Option<X>` |
| `TrimmedString` / `TrimmedNonEmptyString` | same-named types; trimming uses `js_trim` (JS `trim()` semantics, not Rust `str::trim`) |
| branded ids (`ThreadId`, …) | declare in the `id!` list in base_schemas.rs (opaque `Arc<str>` newtype with `new`/`random`/`as_str`). Never hand-write id newtypes |
| `Schema.Number` | `f64` (fractional values exist, e.g. `costUsd`) |
| `Schema.Int` / `NonNegativeInt` | `i64` / `u64` |
| `PositiveInt` | `PositiveInt` (validating newtype, rejects 0) |
| `Schema.Record(K, V)` | `IndexMap<K, V>` or `serde_json::Map` (keeps key order; never `HashMap` for persisted data) |
| `IsoDateTime` (`Schema.String`) | `String`, passed through untouched |
| `DateTimeUtc` / `DateTimeUtcFromString` | `UtcDateTime`: always encodes `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ`. Upstream compares these as text (`ORDER BY created_at`), so format drift misorders rows. `IsoDateTime` and `*_at` columns whose upstream schema is `IsoDateTime` stay `String` |
| `Schema.TaggedError` | `thiserror` enum variant, same name |

### Services and effects

| Effect | Rust |
|---|---|
| `Effect.gen` / `Effect<A, E, R>` | `async fn … -> Result<A, E>` |
| `Context.Service` + `Layer` | plain struct; deps passed to `new()` as `Arc<…>`. Trait only when upstream has multiple implementations (provider adapters, VCS drivers, source-control drivers) |
| `Ref` / `SynchronizedRef` | `parking_lot::Mutex` (sync sections) / `tokio::sync::Mutex` (only if held across `.await`) |
| `Deferred` | `tokio::sync::oneshot` (single) / `watch` (many readers) |
| `Semaphore.make(n)` + `withPermits` | `Arc<tokio::sync::Semaphore>`; `acquire_owned` when the permit outlives the scope |
| `Effect.forEach/all(…, {concurrency: n})` | `stream::iter(..).map(f).buffered(n)` (ordered) / `buffer_unordered(n)` if upstream discards order; `"unbounded"` → `try_join_all`; no option → sequential loop |
| `PubSub.unbounded` | per-subscriber `mpsc::unbounded_channel` fan-out (publishing never waits), or `broadcast` **with** an explicit `Lagged` handler that replays from the store |
| `PubSub.sliding(n)` | `broadcast::channel(n)` |
| `Queue.unbounded` / `.bounded(n)` / `.dropping(n)` / `.sliding(n)` | `mpsc::unbounded_channel` / `mpsc::channel(n)` / `try_send` on bounded / `VecDeque` + `Notify` |
| `Stream` | `futures::Stream` |
| `Fiber` / `forkScoped` / `forkDaemon` | task owned by a `JoinSet` or `tokio_util::task::AbortOnDropHandle` tied to its owner, plus `CancellationToken` for cooperative stop. **Never drop a bare `JoinHandle`** (it detaches, unlike Effect's scoped interruption) |
| `Effect.timeout` | `tokio::time::timeout`; on timeout the underlying work must actually stop (abort task / kill process) |
| child processes | `tokio::process::Command` with `kill_on_drop(true)`; long-lived CLIs (providers, hooks) run in their own process group and the group is killed on timeout/shutdown. Hooks, on normal exit: after the shell exits plus a 250 ms drain, the group is killed only if something still holds the stdout/stderr pipes |
| `Schedule` / retries | explicit loop with the same delays and caps |
| `@effect/sql` SQLite | `turin_persistence::Db`: one writer connection (upstream: single writer behind `Semaphore(1)`) + a read-only reader connection, upstream PRAGMAs verbatim. `db.write(|tx| …)` runs a whole transaction in one blocking call; stores take `&Transaction`/`&Connection` so several compose in one transaction (upstream `sql.withTransaction`). Async work (publishing) happens after commit |

**Rules:** never do a bounded `send().await` or any `.await` while holding a
DB transaction or a sync lock.

**Async-first (user rule).** Everything that can be async is async: all IO
(processes, network, SQLite via `Db`, filesystem scans, git) runs on tokio or
gpui's background executor, never on the UI thread; independent work runs
concurrently (`join!`/`buffer_unordered` per the table above) instead of in
sequence unless upstream's ordering is semantically required. UI renders from
cached view models and never awaits.

Async runtime: tokio for all backend work. The GPUI app spawns a multi-thread
tokio runtime at startup and bridges results into entities via channels.

## Module map

| Turin crate | Upstream source |
|---|---|
| `contracts` | `packages/contracts/src` (kept files only, see below) |
| `shared` | `packages/shared/src` (kept files only) |
| `persistence` | `apps/server/src/persistence` (SQLite, migrations, event store) |
| `git` | `apps/server/src/{git,vcs,checkpointing}`, `apps/server/src/workspace` |
| `source-control` | `packages/source-control-{core,github}`, `apps/server/src/{sourceControl,pullRequest}` |
| `provider-core` | `packages/provider-core`, `apps/server/src/provider` (registry, catalog, auth for kept providers) |
| `codex-app-server` | `packages/effect-codex-app-server` (generated protocol types + stdio JSON-RPC client) |
| `provider-codex` | `orchestration-v2/Adapters/CodexAdapterV2.ts`, `provider/Codex*` |
| `claude-protocol` | replaces `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` (pinned version): `claude` CLI launch flags, stream-json frames, control protocol, SDK-local helpers (transcript fork etc.) |
| `acp` | `packages/effect-acp` (Agent Client Protocol JSON-RPC client) |
| `provider-claude` | `orchestration-v2/Adapters/ClaudeAdapterV2.ts`, `provider/Claude*`; the TS Agent SDK is replaced by speaking the `claude` CLI stream-json control protocol directly (same protocol the SDK uses) |
| `provider-opencode` | `packages/provider-opencode`: version probe + both generations (v1 `server/adapter.ts`+`OpenCodeRuntime.ts` for 1.x, which is what users have installed today; v2 `server/v2/*` for ≥2) |
| `provider-cursor` | `packages/provider-cursor` minus the in-process `@cursor/sdk` runtime; transport is `cursor-agent acp` via `acp` + upstream `AcpAdapterV2` (new Cursor flavor, see Deviations) |
| `orchestration` | `apps/server/src/orchestration-v2` (minus wire/transport files), `apps/server/src/project` |
| `hooks` | **new**, replaces thread launch / worktree creation (see below) |
| `app` | `apps/web/src` → GPUI, `packages/client-runtime/src/state` reducers. Binary `turin`. |

When a kept type references a cut type, drop that field and note it in
Deviations.

## Cut list (whole features)

- T3 Connect, relay, cloud, remote access, pairing, auth/sessions, DPoP, Tailscale, SSH, WSL
- Mobile app, marketing site, Electron shell, auto-updates, telemetry, resource telemetry
- Every source-control host except GitHub (GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, Forgejo, GitCafe)
- Every provider except Codex, Claude, OpenCode, Cursor (no ACP registry, Grok, Pi, Muse, Antigravity)
- Terminal / PTY, browser / preview / devices, HTML render, MCP apps, orchestrator MCP server
- File tree side panel, scheduled tasks, legacy v1 importer, project clone
- **Thread launch into new worktree / new thread spawning** → replaced by hooks

## Kept features (must match upstream look and feel)

- Sidebar: projects → threads, status indicators, snooze, drag, search, hover cards
- Thread view: messages timeline, markdown, tool cards, approvals, pending user input,
  plan follow-up, context window meter, usage limits, wrapping behaviour
- Composer: rich prompt editor, mentions, model picker, attachments, stash, queue/steer
- Diff: changed files tree, turn diffs, full thread diff, checkpoints and rollback
- Git: status, branches, commit/push flows (`GitWorkflowService`), checkpoints
- GitHub PRs: list + filters, detail (summary, timeline, code, checks, reviews, guide),
  thread↔PR linking, PR stacks, watch/sync reactors, review guides, files viewed
- Settings and keybindings with upstream defaults

## Hooks (new)

Replaces `ThreadLaunchService` / worktree setup. User-defined shell commands
that run on orchestrator events. Config in `~/.turin/hooks.toml` and
per-project `.turin/hooks.toml`:

```toml
[[hook]]
event = "thread.created"        # thread.created | turn.started | turn.completed
                                # | turn.failed | approval.requested | pr.linked
                                # | pr.checks.completed | git.committed
command = "./scripts/setup.sh"
cwd = "project"                 # project | thread (thread's workspace path)
blocking = false                # true: wait before continuing (thread.created only)
timeout_secs = 300
```

Hooks get event JSON on stdin and `TURIN_*` env vars (`TURIN_EVENT`,
`TURIN_PROJECT_ID`, `TURIN_THREAD_ID`, `TURIN_CWD`, …); inherited `TURIN_*`
vars are scrubbed first.

**Trust (QC wf_e8a1a7c1-d53, T21c).** Global `~/.turin/hooks.toml` is trusted.
Project hooks never run until the user approves them. Approval covers the
**whole `<project>/.turin/` tree** (`hooks.toml` plus scripts such as
`.turin/hooks/*.sh`, nothing skipped): `~/.turin/trusted-hooks.json` maps the
canonical project root → one SHA-256 over sorted relative paths + file bytes.
Any change to any file there (git pull, branch switch, an agent edit)
invalidates it; the hash is re-checked on every reload **and on every
dispatch**, dropping project hooks while keeping global ones. A symlink that
resolves outside `.turin/` makes the project hooks *untrustable* (inert, Approve
refused, reason surfaced). Commands that run repo files *outside* `.turin/`
(`./scripts/x.sh`) are allowed but not covered: they are listed in
`PendingProjectHooks::unhashed_references` so the UI warns, and the docs steer
authors to keep scripts in `.turin/hooks/` (and to use
`$TURIN_PROJECT_ROOT/.turin/…` under `cwd = "thread"`). Untrusted/changed hooks
surface as a pending status the UI shows with an "Approve" action.
Rationale: upstream never auto-runs repo-supplied commands (`t3.json` scripts
are import-only).

**Return protocol.** A blocking `thread.created` hook may print, as its last
stdout line, a JSON object `{"worktreePath": "...", "branch": "..."}` (both
optional). The orchestrator then binds the new thread to that workspace, which
is how hooks replace upstream's launch-into-worktree flow. Malformed or absent
output = no change.

**Environment.** Hooks inherit the app's environment; PATH hydration from the
login shell (upstream `fixPath` / `readEnvironmentFromLoginShell`) happens once
at app startup (T05b/T22), not per hook.

## Deviations

| File | Upstream | Turin | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `assets/prod/black-macos-1024.png` | exported from Icon Composer GUI with the "macOS pre-Tahoe" preset | synthesized from upstream's macOS PNG (T3 glyph erased, T redrawn with upstream's gradient/edges); validated against an `actool` render. `--keep-macos-png` keeps a GUI export instead | Icon Composer's CLI has no pre-Tahoe preset |
| `assets/{dev,nightly}` | blueprint/nightly icon variants | not produced | single prod build; variants aren't trivial (grid, annotations) |
| `provider-cursor` (credentials) | SDK uses explicit apiKey / CURSOR_API_KEY / stored login per Agent instance | `cursor-agent acp` reads stored login with precedence over env/flags at process start and may write the global credential store during `authenticate` | CLI-owned auth; Turin only triggers `authenticate` explicitly and never with `authenticateOnAuthRequired`. docs/protocols/cursor-acp.md "Credentials" |
| `provider-cursor` (permission outcomes) | SDK path rejects interactive approvals (adapter.ts:2499) | ACP `session/request_permission` is answered: allow-once / labelled option; allow-always maps to Cursor's global allowlist; never launches with `--force`/`--yolo` | ACP exposes approvals; gaining them matches T3's approval UX for other providers |
| `provider-cursor` (acp-config) | n/a | snapshot/restore of `~/.cursor/acp-config.json` around per-thread model changes, scoped to keys Turin touches | limits ACP's global side effect (see model-selection row) |
| `provider-opencode` (v1 SSE) | v1 SDK reconnects 3s→30s, no watchdog/backfill | Turin applies the v2-style 45s raw-byte watchdog + manual reconnect + backfill to v1 too | one transport policy; avoids silent stalls on 1.x. docs/protocols/opencode.md v1 SSE |
| `provider-cursor` (ACP model selection) | SDK sends `{id, params}` per send; no global side effects | ACP `set_config_option`/`set_model` with `parameterizedModelPicker`; Cursor CLI persists the choice to `~/.cursor/cli-config.json` + `acp-config.json` and syncs all sessions in the process | ACP is the only stable transport. Mitigation: one `cursor-agent acp` process per thread; snapshot/restore user config if the side effect proves visible. QC wf_42618e43-71a item 14 |
| `provider-cursor` | runs `@cursor/sdk` local executor in-process (Node) | `cursor-agent acp` subprocess over ACP | Rust can't host the JS SDK and it has no stable wire protocol; ACP is Cursor's supported external protocol. Gains interactive approvals; loses SDK-only features (autoReview, run recovery via listRuns, per-send `{id,params}` model selection). QC wf_42618e43-71a |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `TrimmedNonEmptyString` trims only on decode/encode | trims at construction | no untrimmed state can exist, so `" "` can never encode to `""` |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `UnknownUnionMember { tag, value }` | adds `raw: Value` | lets callers render/log unknown members without re-reading the row |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `DateTimeUtc` keeps ms precision via JS `Date` | `UtcDateTime` truncates to ms on construction/parse | `Eq`/`Ord` agree with the wire form |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `PositiveInt` is a refined number | newtype over `NonZeroU64` with `new(u64) -> Option<Self>` | 0 unrepresentable |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `isUnknownUnionMember(value)` | no function; match `ForwardCompatible::Unknown` | Rust enums make it a pattern |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | `PortSchema` | omitted | only used by cut features |
| `contracts/base_schemas.rs` | cut-feature exports (AuthSessionId, RpcClientId, SecretRef, DpopFailureReason, Client* enums) | omitted | features cut (PORTING cut list) |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/reconcileV2PreviewMigration.ts` | Rewrites preview databases that recorded `OrchestrationV2` as migration 53 or 54 so those files keep their ledger and still migrate forward. | Not called. A preview file whose recorded id `>= 55` has a different name, or whose later id would skip a V2 migration, fails closed in `assert_v2_migrations_can_run`. | Fresh databases and released-main files already use the current ids. Rewriting 53/54 would hide a schema this build does not contain. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/OrchestrationEventStore.ts` | Decodes each payload with the orchestration-v2 contract schema. | Payloads stay `serde_json::Value`. Invalid JSON fails. Unknown event types fail a strict read and are skipped when `skip_unknown_event_types` is set. A known type must be a non-empty JSON object. | `turin-contracts` event schemas are not in this crate. Empty-object rejection stands in for "schema rejected a known payload" until those types land. Non-empty but schema-invalid JSON is accepted. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/Errors.ts` | Decode failures name Effect schema issue tags and do not copy the rejected value. | Decode failures carry the serde error string. | There is no Effect schema layer to map. SQL failures still use `SQLITE({code}) {errstr}` and do not include the query text. |
| `packages/shared/src/nodeSqliteClient.ts` | Reader and checkpoint workers are separate Node worker threads. The checkpoint worker uses `wal_checkpoint(NOOP)` and stays off when SQLite is older than 3.51. | One process: a `SQLITE_OPEN_READ_ONLY` connection for reads, and a `std` thread for checkpoints, joined on `Db` drop. Same pragmas, 1000-frame passive threshold, 100ms one-shot idle flush, and writer autocheckpoint of 10000. The side connection is opened before that pragma is raised. The worker is not started when `sqlite_version()` is below 3.51. `:memory:` has no reader and no checkpoint thread. | A second connection cannot see an in-memory database. Bundled SQLite is 3.53.2 (`rusqlite` 0.40 / `libsqlite3-sys` 0.38), so file databases start the worker. Below 3.51 the writer keeps the default autocheckpoint. |
| `packages/shared/src/Sqlite.ts` | `PRAGMA optimize` on the upstream SQLite build does not create `sqlite_stat4`. | The same `PRAGMA optimize = 0x10012` runs. Bundled SQLite is compiled with `SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT4`, so optimize creates `sqlite_stat4` as well as `sqlite_stat1`. | Rebuilding SQLite without STAT4 would fork the bundled amalgamation. The extra stats table is unused by queries. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/initializeV2Database.ts` | After the snapshot copy, orchestration lazily imports V1 transcripts. | Copies the committed V1 snapshot (WAL included, uncommitted rows excluded) and stops. | Transcript import depends on the orchestration importer, which is not this crate. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/Migrations/009_ProviderSessionRuntimeMode.ts` | Intentional `Effect.asVoid` no-op, still recorded. | Empty script, id still inserted. | Same ledger outcome. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/Migrations/006_*.ts` | Binds `DEFAULT_RUNTIME_MODE` (`full-access`) as a parameter. | The literal `'full-access'` is in the SQL file. | The extracted script has no parameter slot. The written value is the same. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/Migrations/055_OrchestrationV2.ts` | `ApplicationEventSource` runs between thread-launch workflows and effect-cancellation, including a procedural copy. | The generated SQL has `-- TURIN_APPLICATION_EVENT_SOURCE --`. The runner executes the copy in Rust at that point. | Concatenating the TypeScript module would run its static receipt insert before the events it depends on exist. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/*` timestamps | `*_at` values are UTC text `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ`. | Caller-supplied strings are stored as given. Values this crate generates use `chrono` `to_rfc3339_opts(SecondsFormat::Millis, true)`. SQL `strftime` expressions are unchanged. | `turin_contracts::UtcDateTime` is not on this branch yet. |
| `hooks` project `.turin/` | Upstream never runs commands from repo files; `t3.json` scripts are import-only (`resolveProjectScripts` reads settings only). | Project hooks are inert until the user approves the **whole `.turin/` tree**: `~/.turin/trusted-hooks.json` maps canonical project root → SHA-256 over sorted relative paths + bytes of every file under `.turin/`; re-checked on reload and on every dispatch. Symlinks leaving `.turin/` are untrustable. Commands running repo files outside `.turin/` are allowed but reported as `unhashed_references` (best-effort text scan; those files are not covered). Pending/changed hooks surface as `HookUpdate::ProjectHooksPending`; `HookRunner::trust_project_hooks(reviewed_hash)` approves. Global `~/.turin/hooks.toml` is trusted. | Hot-reloaded repo-controlled shell execution would otherwise run on clone/pull/agent edit. Residual: scripts outside `.turin/` can change without re-approval (same limit as direnv); the UI warns. QC wf_e8a1a7c1-d53 item 1, wf_44e1924e-b5c item 1. |
| `hooks` environment | `fixPath` / `readEnvironmentFromLoginShell` / `mergePathEntries` (+ launchctl fallback) hydrate `process.env.PATH` once at server startup (`os-jank.ts`). | `turin-hooks` inherits the app env and does no per-hook hydration. **Tracked:** port that hydration into `turin-shared` and call it once at app startup (T05b/T22). | Until then a Finder-launched app gives hooks `/usr/bin:/bin` (`gh`, `npm`, `bun` → exit 127). QC item 5. |
| `hooks` thread launch | `ThreadLaunchService` creates the worktree and binds the thread. | A blocking `thread.created` hook prints `{"worktreePath","branch"}` as its last stdout line; `DispatchSummary.thread_workspace` carries it and the orchestrator binds the thread. | Hooks replace launch-into-worktree (return protocol above). QC item 7. |
| `hooks` process exit | `processRunner.ts` waits for stdout/stderr EOF and never kills the group on normal exit (a background job holding the pipes stalls the run until timeout). | The run ends when the shell exits plus a 250 ms drain; if anything still holds the pipes, the whole group is killed (including output-redirected jobs). Daemons must leave the group (`setsid`). Timeout/shutdown always kill the group, using the pgid recorded at spawn. | A hook must not hang `thread.created` for the full timeout because of a stray `cmd &`; the early kill is the safe failure direction. QC wf_44e1924e-b5c item 2. |
| `apps/server/src/persistence/*` timestamps | Agent-event `occurredAt` is `DateTimeUtc`. Project `occurredAt`, receipt `acceptedAt`, and provider `lastSeenAt` are `IsoDateTime`. | Agent-event `occurred_at` is `UtcDateTime` and is stored with its canonical `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ` display. Project, receipt, and provider `*_at` stay caller-supplied strings. SQL `strftime` expressions are unchanged. | Only the agent-event field is `DateTimeUtc` upstream. The other timestamps are `IsoDateTime` pass-through. |
